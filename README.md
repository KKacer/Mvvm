# Mvvm
Blazor/Xamarin.Forms Cross-Platform Demo Template

I took the Blazor default template and the Xamarin.Forms default templates from Visual Studio 2019, 
extracted their logic into a shared business library with viewmodels, and then implemented all the views
cross-platform from both projects.

The goal was to prove (to myself, mostly), that cross-platform development with MVVM and reusable ViewModels was possible.
